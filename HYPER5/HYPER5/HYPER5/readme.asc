#### HYPER5 is part of the UDEMY Course: CADAC Studio, Lesson 2    ####
#### HYPER5 is based on the CRUISE5 architecture with aerodynamic  ####
#### and propulsion data from the AFRL unrestricted report         ####
#### "Generic Hypersonic Vehicles for Conceptual Design Analyses"  ####
#### Brent Ruttle, Jacob Stork, Glenn Liston, Sept 2012.           ####
#### The detailed description of CRUISE5  can be found at the AIAA ####
#### Study Series: "Building Aerospace Simulations in C++", or the ####
#### Amazon Book: "C++ Aerospace Workshop in Two Days", and the    ####
#### UDEMY Course "C++ in Aerospace Simulations".                  ####
#### HYPER5 is  designated 'open source' and is provided without   ####
#### warranty or liability.  Peter H Zipfel, MaSTech.              ####

* Release 1.0  Jan 2024  in VS C++ 2022  

* If you have Visual Studio 2022 installed, just click on file HYPER5.sln, compile and run.
  You will be running the input.asc file. To run the other input files you have to first copy 
  them to input.asc.

* If you use older MS Visual C++ compiler versions, you have to build the Project/Solution
  in that environment

* To get access to the plotting and analysis programs of CADAC Studio, go to 
			https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.102509 -> Supplemental Material
  CADAC Studio is compatible with all MS Windows ORs

* An alternate plotting option is provided by creating CSV (comma separated variables) formatted plot files.
  -> At the OPTION line in 'input.asc' insert 'y_csv'. The plot.asc and traj.asc files will be written in CSV
	  format, which is compatible with Excel, MATLAB, SCILAB, and several other plotting programs.
